## About
This is the Mini-Project for SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence which focuses on the analysis and prediction of used car prices. We used data from  [Old car price prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/milanvaddoriya/old-car-price-prediction) to make our predictions for car prices. This database contains used car prices from India up to the year 2022.
Our source code follows the order of:
1. Data cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Machine learning

## Problem Definition

- Is is possible to predict the price of a used car based on its different characteristics?
- What would the best model for prediction be?
  
## Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Binary Search Tree
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)
  
## Conclusion
- Majority of car prices fall under $50,000
- When looking at factors, age determined by manufacture year, brand and mileage are the highest contributing factors
- XGB would be the best model to predict car price
- It is possible to predict the price of a used car based on different characteristics

## What we learned from this project
- Data cleaning, filtering our unnecessary parts of the data and conversion from obect to integers
- Decision tree regressor, similar to decision tree classifier we learnt but for continuous values
- XGB
